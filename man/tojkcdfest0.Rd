\item{X22}{vector of half-panel cross-sectional data based on time series (T/2 + 1) ~ T}

\item{X31}{vector of one-third-panel cross-sectional data based on time series 1 ~ T/3}

\item{X32}{vector of one-third-panel cross-sectional data based on time series (T/3 + 1) ~ 2 * T/3}

\item{X33}{vector of one-third-panel cross-sectional data based on time series 2 * T/3 + 1 ~ T}

\item{h}{bandwidth}
