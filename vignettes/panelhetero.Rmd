This vignette explains how to use the package **panelhetero** in **R**.

The package implements model-free procedures proposed by Okui and Yanagi (2017, 2018) to examine the degree of heterogeneity across cross-sectional units based on panel data.


## Setting
Let $\{ \{ y_{it} \}_{t=1}^T \}_{i=1}^N$ be balanced panel data where $y_{it}$ is a scalar random variable, $N$ is the number of cross-sectional units, and $T$ is the length of time series.
We assume that the individual time series $\{ y_{it} \}_{t=1}^T$ is strictly stationary across time but heterogeneous acorss units.

To examine the properties of heterogeneity, we focus on estimating the cumulative distribution function (CDF), density, and moments (i.e., the means, variances, and correlations) of the heterogeneous mean, $k$-th autocovariance, and $k$-th autocorrelation:
\begin{align*}
  \mu_i = E(y_{it}|i),
  \qquad
  \gamma_{k,i} = E[(y_{it} - \mu_i)(y_{i,t-k} - \mu_i)|i],
  \qquad 
  \rho_{k,i} = \frac{\gamma_{k,i}}{\gamma_{0,i}},
\end{align*}
where $E(\cdot|i)$ indicates the population mean for the individual time series.
In words, $\mu_i$, $\gamma_{k,i}$, and $\rho_{k,i}$ are the population mean, $k$-th autocovariance, and $k$-th autocorrelation for the individual time series.
Note that $\gamma_{0, i}$ is the variance.
They are random variables as discussed in Okui and Yanagi (2017, 2018).
We assume that they are i.i.d. across units.

The estimators of $\mu_i$, $\gamma_{k,i}$, $\rho_{k,i}$ are given by the sample analogues:
\begin{align*}
  \hat \mu_i = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T y_{it},
  \qquad
  \hat \gamma_{k,i} = \frac{1}{T-k} \sum_{t=k+1}^T (y_{it} - \hat \mu_i)(y_{i,t-k} - \hat \mu_i),
  \qquad 
  \hat \rho_{k,i} = \frac{\hat \gamma_{k,i}}{\hat \gamma_{0,i}}.
\end{align*}

For $\xi_i = \mu_i$, $\gamma_{k,i}$, and $\rho_{k,i}$, the parameters of interest are the CDF $F_{\xi}(\cdot) = \Pr(\xi_i \le \cdot)$, the density $f_{\xi}(\cdot)$, the mean $E(\xi_i)$, the variance $var(\xi_i)$, and the correlations such as $cor(\mu_i, \gamma_{k,i})$.

Okui and Yanagi (2017) develop empirical distribution estimation of the CDF and the moments of the true $\mu_i$, $\gamma_{k,i}$, and $\rho_{k,i}$ based on the estimated $\hat \mu_i$, $\hat \gamma_{k,i}$, and $\hat \rho_{k,i}$.
Okui and Yanagi (2018) also propose nonparametric kernel smoothing estimation for the CDF and the density of the true $\mu_i$, $\gamma_{k,i}$, and $\rho_{k,i}$ based on the estimated $\hat \mu_i$, $\hat \gamma_{k,i}$, and $\hat \rho_{k,i}$.
Further, the papers develop half-panel jaccknife (HPJ) bias-correction methods to eliminate asymptotic biases of the estimators and cross-sectional boostrap procedures for statistical inferences.
See the papers for more details.

**panelhetero** implements these procedures.

In the following, we explain the arguments and the returned values of each function.


## `nemoment`

`nemoment` implements the naive estimation for the moments without bias-correction.
The parameters are the means, variances, and correlations:
\begin{align*}
  & E(\mu_i), \qquad E(\gamma_{k,i}), \qquad E(\rho_{k,i}),\\
  & var(\mu_i), \qquad var(\gamma_{k,i}), \qquad var(\rho_{k,i}),\\
  & cor(\mu_i, \gamma_{k,i}), \qquad cor(\mu_i, \rho_{k,i}), \qquad cor(\gamma_{k,i}, \rho_{k,i}).
\end{align*}

The usage is `nemoment(data, acov_order = 0, acor_order = 1, R = 1000)` where the arguments are as follows.

The default is `acor_order = 1`.

## `neecdf`

`neecdf` implements the naive estimation for the empirical CDF without bias-correction.

Note: In each graph, x-axis limits are set as the minium and maximum of the estimated quantities (e.g. the estimated means).

## `hpjecdf`

The parameters are the CDFs of $\mu_i$, $\gamma_{k,i}$, and $\rho_{k,i}$.

Note: In each graph, x-axis limits are set as the minium and maximum of the estimated quantities (e.g. the estimated means).

Note: Since the HPJ bias-corrected CDF estimator may be a non-monotonic function as a consequence of the bias-correction, we convert the HPJ bias-corrected estimator into a monotonic function based on a rearrangement procedure in **Rearrangement**.
As a result, the graphs `mean`, `acov`, and `acor` are monotonic functions.

Note: The functions `mean_func`, `acov_func`, and `acor_func` are not subject to rearrangement, since **Rearrangement** cannot return functions.
Nontheless, you can manually use **Rearrangement** to obtain rearranged estimates.

Note: Since the HPJ bias-corrected CDF estimates may be smaller than 0 or greater than 1 as a consequence of the bias-correction, we impose the restriction that the estimates are no less than 0 and no larger than 1.

## Example

We illustrate the use of **panelhetero** through the following simple example.
We generate simulated data based on AR(1) model with heterogeneous random coefficients.

```{r, eval = TRUE}

set.seed(101)

# sample sizes
N <- 300
S <- 50

# heterogeneous random coefficients
c <- rnorm(N, mean = 0, sd = 1)
phi <- rbeta(N, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5)
sigma <- rbeta(N, shape1 = 2, shape2 = 5) + 0.5

# initializing N * (T + 1) data matrix including intial values
y <- matrix(0, nrow = N, ncol = S + 1)

# generated by AR(1) model
for(i in 1:N) {
  
  # unobserved initial value
  y[i,1] <- rnorm(1, mean = c[i], sd = sigma[i])
  
  for(t in 2:(S+1)) {
    y[i, t] <- (1 - phi[i]) * c[i] + phi[i] * y[i, t-1] + 
      sqrt((1 - phi[i])^2 * sigma[i]^2) * rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  }
}

# N * T data matrix
y <- y[, -1]
```

We can estimate the moments of the heterogeneous mean, autocovariance, and autocorrelation via `nemoment` and `hpjmoment.`
For example, we can implement the HPJ bias-corrected estimation for the moments as follows.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library("panelhetero")

set.seed(101)

r1 <- hpjmoment(data = y, acov_order = 0, acor_order = 1)

r1$estimate

r1$se

r1$ci
```

We can also implement the empirical and kernel CDF estimation and the kernel density estimation via `neecdf`, `hpjecdf`, `nekd`, `hpjkd`, `nekcdf`, and `hpjkcdf`.
For example, we can estimate the density of $\mu_i$ based on the HPJ bias-corrected kernel density estimation as follows.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
r2 <- hpjkd(data = y, acov_order = 0, acor_order = 1)

r2$mean
```

The graph is plotted via **ggplot2**, so that we can customize it through standard commands for **ggplot2** (e.g., customizing the title, background, axes, and labels).
For example, we can customize the title and the theme as follows.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)

r2$mean + ggtitle("The density of the mean") + theme_classic()
```

Also, `neecdf`, `hpjecdf`, `nekd`, `hpjkd`, `nekcdf`, and `hpjkcdf` return the functions `mean_func`, `acov_func`, and `acor_func` that return values of the estimated functions.
By using these functions, you can plot graphs on your own.
For example, the graph of the HPJ bias-corrected density for the mean can be plotted as follows.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-3.5, 3.5)), aes(x = x)) + 
  stat_function(fun = r2$mean_func) + ggtitle("The density of the mean")
```

This usage is useful especially when you would like to plot a graph with a specified range or when you would like to overlay several graphs.
